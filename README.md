## 📁 Project Structure

This is a modern frontend app scaffolded with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), using:

- ⚛️ **React** for components and routing
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling
- 🎨 **DaisyUI** for beautiful UI components
- ⚡ **pnpm** for fast and efficient package management
- 🗂️ Pages: `Home`, `About`, `Download` — all routed via React Router DOM
